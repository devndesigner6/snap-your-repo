# Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with:

```
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token_here
```

This file is listed in `.gitignore` and won't be committed to GitHub.

For Vercel deployment, add the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable in Vercel dashboard:
- Go to Project Settings → Environment Variables
- Add key: `GITHUB_TOKEN`
- Add value: Your GitHub personal access token
- Save and redeploy
